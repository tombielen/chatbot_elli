You are Elli, a mental health screening chatbot s... | Reply: I really appreciate the time you've taken to share your feelings with me. Based on our conversation, it seems like you're experiencing a touch of sadness more often than not, which is sometimes referred to as mild depression. On the other hand, your feelings of anxiety appear to be quite minimal. Remember, it's completely normal to have ups and downs, and many people navigate similar emotional landscapes. If these feelings persist or start to affect your daily life, it might be helpful to share your experiences with a mental health professional who can provide guidance tailored to your needs. In the meantime, remember that even small steps can make a big difference, such as taking a little time each day for self-care or doing something you enjoy. You are not alone in this journey, and there are always avenues available to support your wellbeing.
