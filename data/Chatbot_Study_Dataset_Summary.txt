Summary of Cleaned Dataset Structure (Chatbot Study)

Dataset title: Chatbot_Study_Data_Cleaned.xlsx
Rows: Each row corresponds to a unique participant.
Unit of analysis: Individual participant responses to the experimental interface and assessments.

Inclusion and Exclusion Indicators
----------------------------------
Dropout_status:
  - 0: Participant completed the study and is eligible for analysis
  - 1: Participant dropped out or was excluded; not included in analysis

Participant_status:
  - 0: Participant is valid and included
  - 1: Participant officially dropped out mid-study
  - 2: Participant excluded due to predefined rules (e.g., underage, technical issue)

Reason:
  - Text description explaining exclusion or dropout (e.g., “Technical issue”, “Under 18”)

Experimental Condition (Independent Variable)
---------------------------------------------
Version:
  - "Elli": Participant interacted with the conversational GPT-4 chatbot
  - "static": Participant completed the same questionnaires in a plain static web form

Psychological Measures
----------------------
PHQ-9 Items: PHQ1 to PHQ9 (individual items), Total_PHQ (sum score, 0–27)
GAD-7 Items: GAD1 to GAD7 (individual items), Total_GAD (sum score, 0–21)

Subjective Ratings (Primary Dependent Variables)
------------------------------------------------
All rated on a 6-point Likert scale (0–5):
  - Trust: Trust in the interface
  - Comfort: Emotional comfort during the experience
  - Empathy: Perceived empathy of the interface

Other Columns
-------------
Mood: Optional open-ended input describing the participant's mood at start
Feedback: Open-ended qualitative feedback at the end (yes, no, or blank)
Age: Open text field (cleaned for underage participants)
Gender: Multiple choice (with open-ended option if applicable)

Notes on Cleaning
-----------------
- Completion time was excluded from the final dataset but used during cleaning to filter out invalid participants (<60s).
- Dataset contains both complete and excluded entries; only those with Dropout_status == 0 and Participant_status == 0 are used in final analyses.

Ready for Analysis
------------------
Participants with:
  - Dropout_status == 0 AND
  - Participant_status == 0
...are included in inferential statistics and hypothesis testing.

Special Rule for Static Condition:
----------------------------------
For participants in the static version:
- If they did not complete all 9 PHQ-9 items (which are presented first), they are marked as "excluded".
- If they completed all PHQ-9 items but did not reach the Trust, Comfort, and Empathy questions, they are marked as "dropped out".
- The absence of feedback alone does not result in a dropout classification.
